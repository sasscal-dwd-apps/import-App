# import-App
*Import data from different sources into CLIMSOFT db*

The Application import-App has been developed under the SASSCAL initiative (http://www.sasscal.org) through the Climate Task "Historical and ongoing climate data management" to facilitate the import of data from different sources into any CLIMSOFT database. CLIMSOFT (http://www.climsoft.org) is a Climate Data Management System (CDMS) developed in Africa and installed in the meteorological services of the SASSCAL-partners Angola, Botswana and Zambia.

The tool has been developed under Shiny, an open source R package that provides a powerful web framework for building web applications using R (https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Shiny helps turn data analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge (RStudio, 2017)
