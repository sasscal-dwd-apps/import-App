## From CLICOM
This option is available for the Zambia Meteorological Service (ZMD). It will allow the user to import data from CLICOM into a CLIMSOFT database (either `access` or `mariadb`).

To accomplish the import the user has to follow these steps:

1. Select the Element Code. The user has to know previously which element wants to be imported (e.g. Precipitation). Each element has a code number in CLIMSOFT. This number is the one that has to be entered in this field. As an example, the code of `precipitation` is `5`.


2. Browse to find the '.DLY' file(s) containing the data. These files are those retrieved from CLICOM.  Once the file(s) is(are) found, selected it(them) and click "Open".

3. Select the database of destination: Select the database where the data has to be imported. The user has to define first which kind of database it is (`access` or `mariadb`) and then select one database from the drop down menu `Data Name Source (DNS)`. Note that the list of DNS refers to the ODBC connections available. Therefore, the database has to be previously defined in the *Open Database Connectivity* Tool (see Section [Connection to a database](#odbc))

4. Once step 1 to 3 are completed, a new button called `Start Import` pops-up. Make click on it to start the import of the data.

5. Wait until the import is completed (may take some time, depending on the amount of data)
