## From a database
This option is available for all the meteorological services. It will allow the user to import data from a CLIMSOFT database (either `access` or `mariadb`) into another CLIMSOFT database (either `access` or `mariadb`).

To accomplish the import the user has to follow these steps:

1. Select the database of origin: Select the database where the data to import are stored. Select which type of database is (`access` or `mariadb`) and then select one database from the drop down menu `Data Name Source (DNS)`. Please note that the list of DNS refers to the ODBC connections available. Therefore, the database has to be previously defined in the *Open Database Connectivity* Tool (see Section [Connection to a database](#odbc))

2. Select the database of destination: Select the database where the data has to be imported. The user has to define first which kind of database it is (`access` or `mariadb`) and then select one database from the drop down menu `Data Name Source (DNS)`. Again, the list of DNS refers to the ODBC connections available. Therefore, the database has to be previously defined in the *Open Database Connectivity* Tool (see Section [Connection to a database](#odbc))

3. Once step 1 & 2 are completed, a new button called `Start Import` pops-up. Make click on it. 

4. Wait until the import is completed (may take some time, depending on the amount of data)
