## From a key-entry form
This option is available for all the meteorological services. It will allow the user to import data from a key-entry form into a CLIMSOFT database (either `access` or `mariadb`).

To accomplish the import the user has to follow these steps:

1. Browse to find the MS-Excel files containing the data key entered. Once the file is found, selected and click "Open".

2. Select the database of destination: Select the database where the data has to be imported. The user has to define first which kind of database it is (`access` or `mariadb`) and then select one database from the drop down menu `Data Name Source (DNS)`. Note that the list of DNS refers to the ODBC connections available. Therefore, the database has to be previously defined in the *Open Database Connectivity* Tool (see Section [Connection to a database](#odbc))

3. Once step 1 & 2 are completed, a new button called `Load Data` pops-up. Make click on it. Once it is clicked, the data will be shown on the browser, so that the user can make a quick check of the data. If the data are not correct, please make the corrections in the original key-entry form through the `keyEntry_App`.

4. If the data are fine, then the user can click on `Start Import`. Wait until the import is completed (may take some time, depending on the amount of data)
