## From old MS-Excel files
This option is available for the National Meteorological Service of Angola (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia e Geof√≠sica, INAMET). It will allow the user to import data from old Excel files used as key entry forms at INAMET, into a CLIMSOFT database (either `access` or `mariadb`).

To accomplish the import the user has to follow these steps:

1. Choose the inventory. The user has to browse for the inventory that contains metadata information about the station which data should be imported into CLIMSOFT. This inventory is an MS-Excel file.  

2. Choose the forms. The user has to browse and select the MS-Excel file(s) with the old forms. There are two types of forms: daily and monthly (see Figure 14)

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig.path, "inamet_form_templates.png"))
```

3. Select the database of destination: Select the database where the data has to be imported. The user has to define first which kind of database it is (`access` or `mariadb`) and then select one database from the drop down menu `Data Name Source (DNS)`. Note that the list of DNS refers to the ODBC connections available. Therefore, the database has to be previously defined in the *Open Database Connectivity* Tool (see Section [Connection to a database](#odbc))

4. Once step 1 to 3 are completed, a new button called `Start Import` pops-up. Make click on it to start the import of the data.

5. Wait until the import is completed (may take some time, depending on the amount of data)

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig.path, "from_old_excel_files.PNG"))
```
