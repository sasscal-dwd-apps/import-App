# Install and uninstall

## Install

The Application is stored as a `.zip` file to reduce the size of it. There are two different `.zip` files available:

* `import_compact_small.zip` (approx. 6 Mb): Contains the minimum information to install the App. The user will **require Internet connection** to complete the installation, since the App will have to download the R-Packages from a R-CRAN repository (typically the repository: <http://cran.us.r-project.org>)

* `import_compact_large.zip` (approx. 62 Mb): Contains all the R-Packages and software required for the installation of the App. The user will **not require Internet connection**.

To proceed with the installation, the user has to follow these steps:

1. **Unzip file**: The user has to unzip the `import_compact_small.zip`or `import_compact_large.zip` file and place the content in any folder (e.g. `Desktop`, `Documents` or any other). 

2. **Open import_standalone folder**: This folder contains all the information to install and run the App.

3. **Edit file import.bat**: Right click on that file and select `Edit`. An editor will open the `.bat` file and the user can then modify the path where `R` is located. The default path is:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(file.path("C:", "Program Files", "R", 
              paste0("R-", rversion), "bin", "i386"))
```

    where `R-X.X.X` is the version of `R`, and `i386` contains the `32bit` version of `R`.
    Once the changes have been done, please save the changes and close the Editor.

4. **Run import.bat:** Double click on the file. A command window will pop-up.

5. **Select Meteorological Service**: The user will be asked to enter the meteorological service (either `DMS`, `INAMET`, `ZMD` or `others`). This information has to be entered only once.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig.path, "select_metService.png"))
```

6. **Select Language**: The user will be asked to enter language (either `english` or `portuguese`). This information has to be entered only once.

7. **Download packages:** If the user uses the file `import_compact_small.zip`, then the App will download the required R-Packages automatically from an R-CRAN repository. Otherwise, the App will contain already the required packages. The packages will be saved in:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(RpkgsDir)
```

    > _**Note:** This step may take some minutes. Please be patient._

8. **Unpack and install libraries:** Once the packages are saved locally, the App will proceed to unpack and install the packages as libraries. These libraries will be located in:
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(RlibsDir)
```

    > _**Note:** This step may take some minutes. Please be patient._

Once the installation process is finished, the `import-App` will open automatically. 

The App can be stopped at any time by closing the command window. To re-run the App, execute the file `import.bat` again. The `import_App` will then pop-up automatically. 

## Uninstall

To uninstall the App, just remove the `import_standalone` folder.
