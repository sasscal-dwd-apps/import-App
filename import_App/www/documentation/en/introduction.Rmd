# Introduction
The Application *import-App* has been developed under the SASSCAL initiative (http://www.sasscal.org) through the Climate Task *Historical and ongoing climate data management* to facilitate the import of data from different sources into any CLIMSOFT database. CLIMSOFT (<http://www.climsoft.org>) is a Climate Data Management System (CDMS) developed in Africa and installed in the meteorological services of the SASSCAL-partners Angola, Botswana and Zambia. 

The tool has been developed under Shiny, an open source R package that provides a powerful web framework for building web applications using R (<https://shiny.rstudio.com/>). Shiny helps turn data analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge ([RStudio, 2017](#references))

This manual will give an overview of the Application, explaining how to install it, how to run it and how to use it.
