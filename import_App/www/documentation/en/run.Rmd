# Running the import-App

To run the application it is necessary to have *administrator rights* in the computer. For run the App as administrator, right click on the file `import.bat` and select `Run as administrator`. After a few seconds, a web browser opens. The import-App interface appears directly on the web-browser (see Figure 10) and the application is ready to use!

Once the App is running, it can also be accessed from other computers connected to the Intranet. To access to the import-App from another PC, open a browser (e.g. Mozilla) and type the following Address:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- system("ipconfig", intern=TRUE)
z <- x[grep("IPv4", x)]
ip <- gsub(".*? ([[:digit:]])", "\\1", z)

cat(paste0("http://",ip, ":3181"))
```

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig.path, "data_source.png"))
```

The options available for the import depend on the Met Service selected during the installation process. These options are explained in detail in the next section.
